# Acids

The hardcore modern chemist bartender uses acid solutions to replicate some
citrus formulas. This is my next frontier. I will be updating this eventually.

# Lime Acid

- 94g water
- 4g citric acid
- 2g malic
- 0.04g succinic acid

# Champagne Acid
- 94g water
- 3g tartaric acid
- 3g lactic acid

# Saline
- 80ml water
- 20g salt

# Citric Malic Lactic Acid Solutions
- 94ml water
- 6g the acid

Basically in all these cases but saline we're going for a 6% solution which mimics lime or lemon juice
