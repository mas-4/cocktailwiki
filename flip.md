# Flip

> A Flip's characteristic flavor arises from the combination of a core spirit or
> fortified wine and a rich ingredient.
>
> A Flip is balanced by its rich ingredients, such as eggs, dairy, coconut milk,
> or dense liqueurs and syrups.
>
> A Flip is seasoned with aromatic spices on top of the finished cocktail, a
> role that can also be played by a highly flavorful liqueur, such as amaro.
