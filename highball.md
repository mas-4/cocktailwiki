## Lunar Fizz

[From Kevin Kos](https://youtu.be/Lhuaaayvkhg)

- 45 ml (1 ½ oz) Hendrick’s Lunar gin
- 15 ml (1/2 oz) Violet liqueur
- 22,5 ml (3/4 oz) egg white
- 22,5 ml (3/4 oz) lemon juice
- 10 ml (1/3 oz) simple syrup 1:1
- 2 dashes Lavender bitters
- top up soda

Reverse dry shake everything but the soda (see [techniques](techniques.md) for
how to do that). Pour in a high ball glass, top with soda.

I cannot find Hendrick's Lunar, so sub something floral. I like Hendrick's
Midsummer Solstice while it lasts.

## Lavender 75

From me

- 2 oz London Dry (Beef)
- 1 oz. Lavender Pea Flower & Lavender Syrup \*
- 0.5 oz. Lemon Juice
- Top with a bubbly, preferably rosé

## French 75

From Cocktail Codex

- 1 oz. Plymouth
- 1/2 oz. fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz. simple syrup
- 4 oz. dry sparkling wine
- Garnish: 1 lemon twist

Shake everything but the wine, strain into a chilled flute. Pour in the wine,
stir with a barspoon, express the twist and drop it in.

## Bloody Maria

From me

- 4 oz. V8 Vegetable Juice
- 2 oz. Tequila (Blanco or in a pinch Repo)
- 0.5 oz. Lemon Juice
- 0.25 oz. Worchestershire Sauce
- 2 dashes Tabasco
- 1 dash Cholula
- Pinch of Celery Salt
- Pinch of Black Pepper
- Pinch of Tajín
- Barspoon of Gulden's Prepared Horseradish
- Garnish: Go wild (Olives, Jalepeños, Celery, Bacon, celery salt or Tajín
  rimmer, whatever, just don't put a damn pizza on the thing.)

Get two pint glasses, mix in one of them and fill with ice. Pour back and forth
between the pint glasses until chilled. Best served in a rocks glass on a large
rock with a floral celery stalk.
