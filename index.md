# Standingwater Cocktail Wiki

N.B. Some recipes call for a tsp. Just sub a barspoon. Damn jerks.

## Internet Resources

### YouTubers

- [How to Drink](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioZY1p0bZ4Xt-yodw8_cBQ): This
  is a fantastic channel I watch religiously. His themed cocktails get a little
  old, but everything is incredible for history and technique.
- [Anders Erickson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEK-PgJHg4Jupi7k7re0qGg):
  This pandemic newcomer is a great hipster bartender. Very earnest. Some great
  cocktail recommendations.
- [Cocktail Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o0CfpOyFJOfyWKtqS1hZQ):
  Nick just released a book, and its got bad reviews. But Nick's channel is
  fantastic for some more advanced techniques. I get milk punch from him, as
  well as clear ice.
- [Uncle Pete's Cocktail Shop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_zC2hf2HmYJIu7acB1MeSw):
  Haven't watched Uncle Pete in a while, but he's especially good for some syrup
  techniques. It seems to be his specialty.
- [The Educated Barfly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu9ArHUJZadlhwt3Jt0tqgA):
  Leandro is pretty great, he's far more prolific than Greg, but not quite as
  fun.
- [Cocktail time with Kevin Kos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEiui9T4ZYx8K8nuZ5YFSTw):
  Kevin's cocktails are great shows but rarely easy to reproduce.

### Other Sites

- [Punch's Recipes](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/): Punch's recipes are by far
  among the most complex I've ever found. It's like if Death \& Co. turned it up
  to 11. I can rarely make anything from here. They sound good though!. I did
  manage their Leeward Negroni. I should try that again.
- [Liquor.com's Recipes](https://www.liquor.com/cocktail-and-other-recipes-4779343):
  These are usually my go to recipes. They're simple, straightforward, and
  easily modifiable.
- [Difford's Guide](https://www.diffordsguide.com): Difford's is about as good as
  Liquor.com but they have a really annoying tendency of using non quarter ounce
  measures, like 2/3 oz. or 4/5 oz. That can be infuriating and I just round or
  hit a half way point in my jigger.

## Cocktail portals

Cocktail Codex breaks down all cocktails into 6 base cocktails everything else
is a riff on. I'm going to follow a similar strategy here. Each link below
consists of the best rendition I've found of the base cocktail and a lot of
variations.

Cocktail Codex lacks two categories I've taken to including in my head: Tiki and
Negroni. Occasionally a variation from Cocktail Codex in particular don't fit
with the original recipe enough to fit in the true template. An example is their
Poet's Dream, which is a Negroni variation. The CC Poet's Dream is a Martini.

Some of these will be stubs. I created them initially as a framework to which I
can keep adding on.

- [Old Fashioned](old_fashioned.md): Spirit forward with a sweetener and
  bitters.
- [Martini](martini.md): Balance between spririt and aromatized wine.
- [Negroni](negroni.md): Equal parts cocktails (or close), and their variants.
- [Daiquiri](daiquiri.md): Spirit, citrus, and sweetener.
- [Sidecar](sidecar.md): Mostly spirit and liqueur.
- [Whiskey Highball](highball.md): A cocktail topped with a nonalcoholic mixer
  (e.g. tonic).
- [Flip](flip.md): Spirit or fortified wine and a rich ingredient.
- [Tiki](tiki.md): Basically punch.
- Finally, my own inventions, [Standingwater's Own](standingwaters_own.md)
