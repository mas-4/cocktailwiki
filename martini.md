***— Cocktail Codex***

One key thing to note about the Martini is that most people are using shitty or
rancid vermouth. Vermouth is an aromatized wine, so it spoils just like wine.
Keep it in the fridge, it'll last about amonth. Buy decent vermouth. Dolin and
Noilly Prat are two popular ones. Cocchi Americano is also popular, as is Punt e
Mes and Cinzano. They will all taste different. Some recipes call for exact
vermouths. Subbing is a gamble.

Another thing to note is that, if you're using good vermouth, you're going to
want to use more of it. Don't skimp on the vermouth. A decent ratio is 2:1 gin
to vermouth if you're using good vermouth.

Orange bitters are great in a martini.

The garnish is very, *very* integral to the overall flavor. Literally just try
making 6 martinis with 6 different garnishes (cocktail olive, pickled onion,
lemon twist, orange twist, lime twist, and one sans garnish) and you'll see how
different they can be.

STIR. Strain into a glass as cold as you can get it. Make sure to properly
dilute. Express the lemon twist. They rest it on the rim. Use a Nick & Nora. Old
