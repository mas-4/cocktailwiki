# Negroni

Cocktail Codex actually classifies the Negroni as a Martini:

> By and large, the cocktails in this chapter are characterized by a core flavor
> of spirit and vermouth or another aromatized wine, and generally speaking,
> they fail when those components aren't in balance. However, there is an
> exception to this rule (as there always is): the Negroni, a deeply bitter
> cocktail made with a full ounce of Campari. Because it brings a lot of proof
> to the drink, the Negroni has less gin, and it finds its balance in the
> typical core of gin and vermouth, but in an equal-parts combination in which
> the amaro is a unified part of the core, with the gin providing a clean
> structure upon which the bitterness of Campari is balanced by the richness of
> the sweet vermouth.

I say, fuck that, the Negroni is another base cocktail: an equal parts template.
It is defined by a balance between three equal parts. Some variations will pare
back on one or two of the components to add some balance, and so some personal
judgement calls will be made.
