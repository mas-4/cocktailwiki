## Cocktail Codex Old Fashioned

- 2 oz. Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
- 1 tsp. Demerara Gum Syrup (see [syrups](syrups.md))
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 1 dash Bitter Truth aromatic bitters
- Garnish: 1 orange twist
- Garnish: 1 lemon twist

Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a double Old-Fashioned glass
with the largest ice cube you can find. Express the orange twist over the drink,
then gently rub it around the rim of the glass and place it in the drink.
Express the lemon twist over the drink, then place it into the drink, do rub the
rim.

**_Tip: do not stir too long over the ice. You want to get it cold but keep it
under-diluted. Keep in mind it will be over ice._**

**_Variant: sub Bitter Truth Jerry Thomas' Own Decater bitters for the
Angostura._**

## Chrysanthemum

> A low-proof Old-Fashioned that doesn't contain a base spirit, sugar-based
> sweetener, or traditional bitters—and that gets served up in a coupe? Say it
> ain't so. Though the Chrysanthemum looks like it hails from the Manhattan or
> Martini family, the proportion of ingredients give away its lineage, with
> small amounts of Bénédictine and absinthe dutifully sweetening and seasoning
> the herbaceous vermouth core.

- 2.5 oz. Dolin dry vermouth
- 0.5 oz. Bénédictine
- 1 tsp. Pernod absinthe
- Garnish: 1 orange twist

Stir over ice, serve up in a chilled coupe. Express the orange peel and rub the
rim with it. Drop it in the glass.

## El Presidente

I really wasn't sure how to classify this, but it looks a lot like an Old
Fashioned with a dual spirit, curaçao as the bitters, and grenadine as the
sweetener.

- 1.5 oz. rum (Havana Club!)
- 1.5 oz. Lillet Blanc
- .25 oz. curaçao
- Barspoon of grenadine (use homemade!)
- Garnish: orange twist.

Stir in mixing glass, strain into coupe, garnish with orange

## Sazerac

- 2 oz. Rye (alt: split with Cognac)
- 0.25 oz. to 0.5 oz. [Demerara Gum Syrup](syrups.md)
- 2 dash Angostura
- 5 dash Peychaud's
- Garnish: 1 lemon twist

Stir, strain into a frozen double rocks glass with no ice. Express the lemon
peel and then discard.
