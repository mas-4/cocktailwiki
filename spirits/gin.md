# Gin

Gin is by far my favorite spirit. It's just vodka. Ironically, I hate vodka and
sneer at flavored vodkas (Gin is technically flavored vodka with some portion of
juniper). "If you want to make a cocktail with vodka, take the vodka and pour it
on your hands to wash them. Then throw away the vodka and make something else."

I have tasted a lot of gin, probably on the order of 30-50 bottles (which
probably sounds like nothing to some gin drinkers, but I would say I know a good
gin when I taste one). I like London Dry a lot, but I can get down with just
about any gin. I have started this list late in my tasting experience, so there
are a lot of gins I've tried not listed here. I'll try to add them as I remember
them.

There are at least 3 official categories of gin:

- London Dry
- Old Tom
- Genever

These don't cover gins enough, so I tend to think of them more like this:

- London Dry
- Japanese
- Irish
- New Age
- Old Tom

I honestly have only recognized one Old Tom (Uncle Val's). The definition is
very loose so I won't use that as a classification much.

My predominant tasting process is just in a Negroni, usually with Cocchi
Vermouth di Torino. I've spent a lot of time drinking 'Groni's, and can tell a
lot about a gin from one even if most people think that's absurd. I don't like
drinking spirits straight. I'll often have them in Martinis as well which
influences my opinion.

Gins are usually made with one of two methods: using a botanical basket during
the distillation process (the vaporized vodka passes through the botanicals) or
the infusion process (take vodka, dump in some stuff, let it sit, strain).
Distillation is by far the most common.

Distillation process tends to be cleaner looking (and cleaner tasting) but you
can make your own infusion gins pretty easily.

For your house gin I cannot recommend enough Beefeater. It can't be beat for its
cleanness and cheapness. In my market it's 17 for a 750 and 25 for a 1.5 liter.
I just opt for the big one.

Below I'll start keeping a list of gins I've tried and some minimal tasting
notes. And some recommendations.

# London Dry

I tend to classify a lot as London Dry. There's a technical definition, and I'm
probably pretty right with most of my classifications because its so simple, but
I just use it as an identifier for "Pretty Normal Gin." Usually I just call
anything juniper forward an LD.

I'll label technical London Dry's LD. Gins I think are pretty normal will get
lumped in here.

- Beefeater: LD, clean, simple. Can be overpowered though.
- Beefeater 24: LD, a lot more puncy and flavorful than standard Beef. Good for
  an occasional splurge.
- Purity 34 Navy Strength: Very strong. Flavorful as well. I like it.
- Bombay Sapphire: LD, a bit more flavor than Beef.
- Tangueray 10: LD, the one and only. This was my father's favorite when I was a
  kid. It's quite lovely, punchier than Beef or Bombay, more citrusy. I reach
  for it when I'm feeling classy. Nothing better than a martini order like "2:1
  Tang 10 Martini with a twist." If they've got Cocchi Americano, oh man.
  Heaven.
- Tangueray: LD, Pretty good, I don't know if it's just status anxiety or what
  but I prefer the 10.
- Plymouth: I know this isn't technically an LD and is a class unto itself, but
  it's just about. It's incredibly agreeable in nearly everything you put it in.
  Similar to beef in that way, but beef is probably more conventional.
- Leopold's American Small Batch: This is made with a lost still called a Three
  Chamber Still. I believe. The company's famous for that in their whiskey. They
  say they did fractional distillation (essentially distilling one vodka through
  one botanical at a time and then combining the distillates to produce the
  gin). However they made it, it's a fine, clean LD tasting gin.
- Linden Leaf 88 Organic Molecular Gin: There are only 28 botanicals, so I don't
  know what the 88 refers to, but it's quite good. Punchier than, say, Leopold's
  but still in the same vein as all of the gins in this list.
- Ford's: eh, nothing special, pretty easy run of the road gin. Overpriced if
  you want that.
- Aviation: Not a fan. Can't say why, it's been a while. It just didn't impress
  me much. Ads are funny, but Reynolds doesn't have a clue how to make a good
  drink.

# Irish Gin

Irish gin tends to be very botanical heavy and reminds me of Rhone wine: rustic.
It's not rustic in the same way as Rhone wine though, because it's more clean.
But it tastes a lot less on the citrus scale and more on the (perhaps?) savory
scale. Where Rhone is very into Garrigue, Irish gin is very into heather.

- Drumshambo: I like this one a lot. It's Irish, though they push a line that
  they're a far eastern gin. Not as punchy as the name implies.
- Glendalough: Very smooth
- Botanist: Incredibly smooth, by far the smoothest gin I've ever tasted that I
  like. This is the quintessential Irish gin in my mind.

# Japanese Gin

Japanese gin is similar to Irish gin (I think there's some weird influence
between them) but seems to be more punchy than Irish gin. Irish gin tends to be
really smooth.

- Nika Coffey Gin: Made by a Japanese whiskey company, this gin is particularly
  punchy, and could easily be a london dry. I like it quite a lot. Really stands
  up in a Negroni.
- 135 East: This was quite good, nowhere near as punchy as the Coffey, but
  delightful.
- Roku: This is pushed a lot in marketing, and its cheap. It's very citrus
  forward, so if that's your thing, it's worth a shot. If you're not into LD, or
  even gin, this might change your mind.

# Old Tom

No idea what to say about this category, I've only got one gin I recongize as
UT.

- Uncle Val's: If you don't like alcohol, buy Uncle Tom's. It's so smooth I hate
  it. I could barely detect it in a Negroni. My mother adored it though. This is
  a technical Old Tom, though they don't advertise it.

# New Age

I think of new ages as unconventional gins, usually more heavy flavoring from
botanicals outside of the convention, often infusion gins.

- Empress 1908: Pretty color. Butterfly Pea Flower is the dominant flavor (and
  color) and I like it well enough. I reach for it occasionally, especially for
  the blue hue to darken an Aviation. Makes a Negroni quite purple. It's not
  weak, either, so it stands up to the Campari.
- Spirit of Prohibition Lavender Gin
- Gin Mare: This is made from olives, I believe literally distilled from them.
  It's good enough, but it wasn't worth the effort (I had to specially order
  it). I especially wanted it for dirty martinis, and it made them nice, but I
  wouldn't say I'd be able to pick out the olive as being especially helpful in
  the dirty.
- Monkey 47: Okay, Monkey is a cult gin and is way overpriced. It's a bit too
  busy for my taste. And technically the 47 botanicals isn't that impressive
  these days. There's a botanical war going on and 47 is still the high bar I've
  seen but, hell, there's a 28 botanical gin in my LD list.
- Hendrick's Cucumber: Favorite of women and non-gin drinkers everywhere. It's
  good, just way overrated. Their specialty bottles are far more interesting.
  Good in a Southside and that's about all I can say for it.
- Hendrick's Midsummer gin: Quite floral. Excellent.
- Hendrick's Orbium: this one is made with wormwood I believe. Bitter, strong,
  excellent. Punches above its weight.
- Hendrick's Lunar Gin: Quite similar to Midsummer. Excellent.
- Tangueray Sevilla Orange: For a while this was my go to in a Negroni. I loved
  it. I fell out of love with orangey, infusion gins so I haven't bought it in a
  while.
