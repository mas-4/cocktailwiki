# Syrups

- Tip: Demerara sugar is hard to acquire but can occasionally be found at Whole
  Foods or Publix. Plenty of random ingredients can also be found on Amazon.
- Tip: I usually aim for 750 ml with rich simple (i.e., 2:1 sugar to water).
- Tip: Save cool looking liquor bottles and strip the labels off of them by
  soaking the bottle in hot soapy water. Sometimes a razor blade can help, also
  a sponge or steel wool. Many gins are sold in nearly identical apothecary
  bottles these days and do just fine. My favorite bottle though is a Monkey 57
  375 bottle for experiments.

**_N.B. Sugars are very different. If I call for one type of sugar, acquire that
kind of sugar. They taste very different._**

## Demerara Gum Syrup (Death & Co. from Cocktail Codex)

This syrup has completely changed the way I view syrups. I use it liberally,
with anything that calls for Demerara syrup. I usually up the recipe to make
750.

> Demerara sugar has large, dark granules. The dark colors comes from the
> molasses naturally present within the sugar, which confers a rich toffee
> flavor. In cocktails, we often use Demerara Gum Syrup to round off the edges
> of intense spirits, as in the Old-Fashioneds, or to add richness. However,
> because of the demerara's molasses-y flavor, there are also limits to its use.
> If we're seeking a clean or sharp flavor in a cocktail, we typically don't use
> this syrup, as it could muddy the drink. In addition, the qualities that round
> the edges of fiery spirits can make it unsuitable for other applications; for
> example, we probably wouldn't use it in a Daiquiri, where it may dull the
> fresh, bright flavors we're looking for. In stirred cocktails, like the
> Old-Fashioned, a gum syrup allows us to add more body to a cocktail without
> making it too sweet.

- 300g (10 oz.) demerara sugar
- 150g (5 oz.) filtered water
- 18g (0.6 oz.) gum arabic

Set up a sous-vide at 145°F.

Combine the demerara and gum arabic in a blender, and run it for about 30
seconds. As it is still running, slowly add the water. Blend for another 2
minutes, until everything seems incorporated. You may have to run a spoon on the
inside to get some gum arabic off the walls and into the blender.

Transfer the contents into a bag and cook in the sous-vide as you would anything
for 2 hours.

Throw it in an ice bath and transfer to a bottle. Per Cocktail Codex, keep
refrigerated up to 2 weeks. That sounds silly to me.

## Simple Syrup

Almost everyone just cooks 1:1 sugar to water. You could easily not cook it,
though. The sugar will incorporate if you just stir a ton.

## Gomme Syrup

I basically just followed
[this recipe from Greg at How to Drink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdvUSn9ak-0)
but used the sous-vide technique for Demerara Gum Syrup instead of cooking it. I
have been experimenting with using it as a substitute for Simple Syrup.

## Pineapple Gum Syrup

> Because of the high pectin levels in pineapple juce, shaken cocktails that
> contain it have a beautiful frothy head, much like that on a cocktail that
> contains egg white. But pineapple juice quickly separates out from the rest of
> a drink, and it can spoil in fairly short order. To combat both of these
> issues, we often incorporate fresh pineapple juice in the form of this syrup,
> which includes a bit of citric acid, which gives the syrup more sharpness and
> clarity, cuts through the sweetness of the sugar, and brightens the natural
> pineapple flavor. As we were developing this syrup, we found that we wanted to
> use it not just in shaken cocktails, but also stirred. So, as in our Demerara
> Gum Syrup, we add a bit of gum arabic, which has the benefit of keeping the
> sugar and pineapple juice in solution. As the ingredients are heated in the
> immersion circulator, the gum arabic dissolves and makes the liquid
> translucent, and the pineapple's pulp and juice break down into a homogenous
> liquid syrup without losing the fruit's bright, tropical flavor.

**_—Cocktail Codex_**

I have made this, and slightly experimented with it, but not enough. I used
older pineapple juice so I want to try making it with fresher juice. I haven't
gotten a good use for it. Yet. It tasted alright as a sub for the demerara syrup
in the SC Planter's Punch.

- 250g (9 oz.) unbleached cane sugar
- 15g (1/2 oz.) gum arabic
- 1.5g citric acid (I try to convert these to oz. but this is so tiny I used a
  jewelry scale).
- 250g (9 oz.) fresh pineapple juice

Literally just follow the same method as in Demerara Gum Syrup. Combine dry
ingredients in a blender, slowly add the pineapple juice, transfer to plastic
bag, 145° in an immersion circulator tub, ice bath.

## Cinnammon Syrup

I made this with a reduction method and would like to try again with an
immersion circulator. Will update when I do.

## Donn's Mix

Literally just 2:1 grapefruit juice to cinammon syrup.

## Honey Syrup

Mix 3:1 honey to water by volume. Whisk it until incorporated.

Avoid clover honey. It tends to dominate. A nice floral honey works best.

## Cane Sugar Syrup

Make it the same way as simple, 2:1 ratio cane sugar to water.

## Death & Co. House Grenadine

This one is supposed to be brighter. To quote Cocktail Codex:

> Many bars make grenadine by reducing pomegranate juice and adding other
> flavorings. The result is a syrup that's murky and dense and, to us, tastes
> nothing like the grenadine we remember from childhood. Sure, that neon-red
> stuff in our Shirley Temple was made with high-fructose corn syrup, but it was
> pretty and we loved it. We wanted to develop a recipe for grenadine that uses
> high-quality ingredients while also honoring our memories of the stuff, and
> eventually came up with this simple, clean version that's incredibly simple to
> make.

- 250g POM Wonderful pomegranate juice
- 250g unbleached cane sugar
- 1.85g powdered malic acid
- 1.25g powdered citric acid
- 0.15g Terra Spice orange extract

Just blend it all in a blender until it's fully incorporated.

## Classic Grenadine

Combine 1:1 pomegranate and sugar in a sauce pan. Bring it to a boil wall
stirring with a whisk. Keep going until it seems fully incorporated. Put a lid
on the pan and take it off the heat. Let it sit for a long time, it has too cool
off. Then transfer it to a bottle.

**_N.B. I have only just begun experimenting with grenadine. I'd like to try
making a this recipe with a bit of gum arabic and using the immersion
circulator. That may be overkill on the syrupiness though, because this
reduction grenadine is already pretty thick. Will be updating this after I
experiment more and try D&C's house grenadine in more drinks._**

**Update: I tried the above NB. It sucks. Just stick to the normal recipe. Don't
go for rich. It gets too thick.**

## Smuggler's Cove Mai Tai Rich Simple Syrup

- 2 cups water
- 4 cups demerara sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the demerara sugar and whisk until
fully incorporated (about 1 minute). Remove from heat and let cool. Add the
vanilla extract and salt and stir to combine. Pour into a bottle.

## Jeffrey Morgenthaler's Lime Cordial

This is the best I've found so far. Make a gimlet with 2:1 gin to this stuff.

His measurements are off the wall.

- 250g sugar
- 8 oz hot water
- 1.5 oz fresh lime juice
- 1.5 oz. freshly grated lime peel measured by volume (lots of grating!)
- 1 oz. citric acid

Blend on medium for 30 seconds, strain, bottle.

## Butterfly Pea Flower & Lavender Syrup

Will update with the recipe later, but requires ordering dry Butterfly Pea
Flowers and Lavender flowers on Amazon.

TODO

## Pandan Cordial

TODO

## Orgeat

I recommend just buying this from Monin. It's good enough and Orgeat is not the
friendliest to shelf stability if its not preservative laden.

## Flower Power

- 250 ml water
- 500 ml sugar
- One pack of edible flowers from Whole Foods

First I did a rapid infusion with the wildflowers and water in a knockoff ISI
whipper (3 chargers). Then after letting it sit a couple hours, I poured all of
it out into a pot and boiled with the sugar to produce a clear simple syrup.
After that I used a regular tea strainer (the kind we use for double straining)
to get the finished product.

## Agave Nectar

I've never made this, just buy it.
