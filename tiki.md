# Tiki

Like Negroni, this category is not in Cocktail Codex, and they would probably
find ways to split them among the other categories. Since Tiki is so
fundamentally coherent a category, with its own special mixing culture, I have
chosen to make it on its own.

The definition of tiki is very

In Smuggler's Cove there is literally a textbook on rum with an 8-number
classification system. SC recipes will have a number for my own reference. If
you want to understand it, buy the book.

Most people don't have 10 different kinds of rum. Try your best to get close to
it because rum is the most varied and worst classified spirit and the recipes
call for different rums for a reason.

## Don's Zombie

Original Don the Beachcomber Zombie from Punch. Gets you hammered. Tastes
strong, but is even stronger.

- 1.5 oz. Jamaican rum (dark, navy)
- 1.5 oz. Puerto Rican rum (golden)
- 1 oz. overproof (151) rum

- 0.25 oz. grenadine
- 2 dashes of absinthe
- 1 dash Angostura bitters

Shake with ice, strain over crushed ice in a collins glass, garnish with mint.

## Fruity Zombie

From
[The Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/zombie-cocktail-recipe-761643),
this is a more palatable zombie, modified by me, that will also get you
hammered, but tastes even less boozy.

- 1 oz. light rum
- 1 oz. dark rum
- 0.5 oz. 151 rum
- 1 oz. orange curaçao
- 0.5 oz. lemon juice
- 0.5 oz. lime juice
- 1.5 oz. orange juice
- 1.5 oz. passion fruit purée/syrup (sub pineapple juice)
- 0.5 oz. grenadine
- 2 dashes bitters
- Garnish: mint sprig

Shake it all, double strain in collins glass over ice, garnish with mint sprig.

**_Variation: sub 0.5 oz. white rum, 0.5 oz. aged rum, 0.5 oz. gold rum, 0.5 oz.
dark rum for the ounce of light and ounce of dark. Makes a more varied drink._**

## Smuggler's Cove Planter’s Punch

By far the best recipe I've found.

glass. Garnish.

**_Variation: use Demerara Gum Syrup. Seriously, you'll be glad you did._**

## Kapok Tree Planter's Punch

Reproduced here from recipe provided by Patty. Shitty as hell, only here for
historical purposes and because why not.

- 2 oz. Orange Juice
- 2 oz. Pineapple Juice
- 2 oz. Lime Juice
- 1 1/4 oz. White Rum
- 1 1/2 oz. Amber Rum
- 1/2 oz. Egg White
- Garnish: cherry
- Garnish: whatever fruit you want

Reverse dry shake (see [techniques](techniques.md), strain into iced collins
glass, float 1/4 oz. grenadine and 1 oz. dark Jamaican rum, garnish with fruit
and cherry.

## Piña Colada Clarified Milk Punch

Makes about 4 servings [From Cocktail Chemistry](https://youtu.be/ZSBzzPvLk6c)
Doesn't go bad. Lots of people find it off putting, especially the Allspice.

- 8oz (240ml) aged rum
- 4.5oz (135ml) coconut water
- 2oz (60ml) Allspice Dram
- 0.5oz (15ml) simple syrup
- 3oz (90ml) fresh pineapple juice, strained
- 2oz (60ml) fresh lime juice, strained
- 5oz (150ml) cold whole milk

1. Add milk to a large glass bowl and set aside
2. Mix remaining ingredients into a pitcher
3. Slowly pour punch mixture into the milk and gently stir until it curdles
4. Let it separate in the fridge, hopefully for a few hours. Don't have an exact
   time
5. Use a cheese cloth to get an initial strain.
6. Use a v60 to strain through.
7. Pour some through, capture with a bowl, and pour the initial back through. An
   initial layer of curds helps with the straining, so you want to capture the
   initial few ounces to refilter through their own curds.
8. This takes forever. Best strategy: pour a ton in, up close to the top of the
   V60. It goes faster when the V60 is fuller because of pressure. So keep it
   topped while you still have some. Resist the urge to squeeze the filter, you
   will pop it and recontaminate the filtered stuff.
9. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator indefinitely
10. Serve in a chilled rocks glass over ice
